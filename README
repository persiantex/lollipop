About Lollipop and its manual.

You have obtained a package containing the Lollipop format 
and its manual.

The manual is a pretty good illustration of the power of
Lollipop, but there is also a file 'address.tex' which
contains example macros for an address book.

Lollipop is still under development. The manual contains
some remarks about what is still to be done. If you have any
questions, remarks, suggestions (or if you want to voice
your appreciation :-) , feel free to contact me:
